# Hi, I'm Omar 👋

I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Camerino (UNICAM), Italy.  
My goal is to enroll in a master's program in Cyber Security after my bachelor's degree.

I'm passionate about ethical hacking and pentesting, and I'm excited to learn and grow in the field of information security.

For now, I use GitHub to share reports and write-ups from the rooms I complete on TryHackMe, which I also add to my LinkedIn profile.
